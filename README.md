## Hi there 👋
My name is Pam Courter, and I am seeking to develop my skills as a data analyst. I have over twenty years of experience using SQL, so I'm pretty old school but I'm excited to grow my skills in visual presentations as a data analyst. I have dabbled in C# web and console applications to meet in-house needs for my last company, Focus Services, but my love has always been with SQL and creating useful reports and answering ad-hoc questions for clients and internal teams to drive productivity. 
I've done so many different projects that many of my accomplishments seem mundane, but I've managed to pull out some major projects from this past year to display on my [SQL Portfolio](https://pamcourter.github.io/SQL-Portfolio/).

I am also excited to be learning more about visualizing data in Excel and PowerBI, and eventually Tableau so I will be posting those here as well. 

Finally, I am eager to learn more about Python and have done a little bit of introductory stuff with it and I will post those as well. 

My goal with this is to display some of my work that provided interesting challenges and learning opportunities, to show how versatile and tenacious I can be in problem solving. 

If you are interested, please see my [resume](/Recs/Pam_Courter_Data_Analyst_Resume.pdf) and a pretty nice [letter of recommendation](/Recs/Pam-Letter_of_Recommendation.pdf) from my previous supervisor and mentor, whom I have worked closely with for many years.
