## Hi there 👋

My name is Pamela Courter and I am seeking to develop my skills as a data analyst. I have over twenty years of experience using SQL, so I'm pretty old school but I'm excited to grow my skills in visual presentations as a data analyst. I have dabbled in C# web and console applications to meet in-house needs for my last company, Focus Services, but my love has always been with SQL and creating useful reports and answering ad-hoc questions for clients and internal teams to drive productivity or make life a little easier for my co-workers and clients. 

My goal here is to display some of my work that provided interesting challenges and learning opportunities, to show how versatile and tenacious I can be in problem solving. Below you can find various portfolios of my past and developing projects. This is still a work in progress so I will be updating often. 

- [SQL/ SSRS Portfolio](https://pamcourter.github.io/SQL-Portfolio/). I've done so many different projects that many of my accomplishments seem mundane to me, but here are some of the projects I've worked on this past year in between campaign and client requests and project maintenance that were a bit more challenging.

- [Visualizations Portfolio](https://pamcourter.github.io/Data-Vizualization/) Nothing  here yet. I am also excited to be learning more about visualizing data in Excel and PowerBI, and eventually Tableau so I will be posting those here. 

- [Python Portfolio](https://pamcourter.github.io/Python-Portfolio/) . I am eager to learn more about Python and have done a little bit of introductory stuff with it. I will post my favorite projects here. 



If you are interested, please see my [resume](/Recs/Pam_Courter_Data_Analyst_Resume.pdf) and a pretty nice [letter of recommendation](/Recs/Pam-Letter_of_Recommendation.pdf) from my previous supervisor and mentor, whom I have worked closely with for many years. 

If you would like to contact me with questions I would be happy to have a chat. \
